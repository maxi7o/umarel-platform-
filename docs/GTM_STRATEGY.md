# 🚀 Operation Umarel: Go-To-Market Strategy v2 (CABA/GBA Focus)

> **"Basta de chamuyo. Mostrá la evidencia."** (Enough bullshit. Show the evidence.)

## 🌟 The Core Value
We are the **Anti-Gig-Economy**. No bidding wars, no bots, no "500 five-star reviews" with zero context.
For Workers: "Don't tell me you're good. Show me a Slice you closed."
For Clients: "Don't pay for promises. Pay for Evidence."

## 🎯 Target Audience & Supply-First Focus

We are shifting to a **Supply-First** approach ("The Crack"). Why? A client with money but no workers bounces instantly. A worker with no immediate job will still hang around if the *promise* of fair work is strong enough.

### 1. The "Crack" (Honest Workers) - **Primary Focus (Bootstrap)**
*   **Who:** Junior/Mid devs, designers, and local tradespeople (gasistas, plomeros) in Argentina who are skilled but drowned out by bots on Upwork/Freelancer or tired of chasing clients on Facebook.
*   **Pain:** "I apply to 100 jobs, get 0 replies because a bot bid $2/hr." / "I did the work and the client ghosted."
*   **Hook:** **"Portfolio de Evidencia."** Unlike GitHub (code) or Behance (pictures), an Umarel Profile proves you *shipped* and *got paid*. It’s un-fakeable reputation.
*   **The Offer:** "Zero fees for first 3 months. Priority ranking in your neighborhood/stack."

### 2. The "Quemados" (Burned Clients) - **Secondary**
*   **Who:** Small business owners (PyMEs) and homeowners in CABA.
*   **Pain:** "The last guy took the 50% advance and vanished."
*   **Hook:** "Pay $0 until you see the photo/video evidence. Money stays in Mercado Pago until you are happy."

### 3. The "Umarels" (The Community) - **Tertiary**
*   **Who:** Experienced seniors (retired or active).
*   **Role:** The "Wise Observer". They validate the evidence when the client doesn't know technical details.

## 📢 Channels: Hyper-Local & High-Trust (Zero Budget)

Forget TikTok dances. We go where the pain is real and the conversation is raw.

### A. The "Vecino" Groups (WhatsApp/Facebook)
*   **Target:** "Vecinos de Palermo", "Albañiles y Gasistas Matriculado", "Freelancers Argentina", "Emprendedores CABA".
*   **Tactic:** DO NOT SPAM. Respond to pain.
    *   *Trigger:* Someone posts "Busco plomero de confianza" or "Busco dev para landing page".
    *   *Reply:* "Don't just hire a random. I'm building a tool where they only get paid if they send photo evidence of the fix. I have 3 verifyied workers on the list. Want me to connect you? commission-free."

### B. The Troll-Free Forums (Reddit & Discord)
*   **Target:** `r/devsarg`, `r/merval`, `r/argentina`.
*   **Tactic:** "The Anti-Chamuyo Thread".
    *   Post: "I'm tired of Upwork bots taking our jobs. I built a platform for us (Argentinos) that tracks *slices* of work (verified evidence) so clients can't ghost payment. Who wants to beta test? No fees."
    *   Value Prop: Focus on *getting paid*, not just getting hired.

### C. Targeted Twitter/X (The "Sniper" Approach)
*   **Target:** Keywords like "estafaron albañil", "dev ghosted me", "necesito programador urgente".
*   **Tactic:**
    *   **Manual (Phase 1):** Personal DM. "Saw you had a bad experience. We track 'Slices' (small verifiable steps). Next time, try this. If they don't upload a photo in 24h, you pay nothing."
    *   **Automated (Phase 2):** Setup visual alerts (Zapier) for these keywords to jump in fast with a helpful (not salesy) comment.

## 🛠 Key Tactics: Next 2 Weeks (Actionable)

### 1. The "Pilot Squad" (Recruiting The Crack)
*   **Goal:** Onboard **20 verifiable workers** (10 Digital / 10 Trade).
*   **Action:**
    *   Post in `r/devsarg` looking for "Devs who deliver".
    *   Direct Message active helpers in Facebook Trade groups ("This answer was great, you clearly know your stuff. Want to be a verified Pro on Umarel?").
*   **Incentive:** "Founding Member" badge (permanent 0% fee on first $1000 earned).

### 2. "Evidence Threads" on X (Show, Don't Tell)
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate the "Slice" mechanic without a complex live event.
*   **Action:**
    *   Take a simple task (e.g., "Fixing the footer on umarel.org").
    *   Thread:
        1.  "Task: Fix broken image."
        2.  "Slice 1: Diagnose ($5)." -> [Screenshot of Error].
        3.  "Slice 2: Fix Code ($10)." -> [Screenshot of Diff].
        4.  "Slice 3: Verify ($5)." -> [Video of working site].
    *   Tagline: "This is how we work. No meetings. Just evidence."

### 3. The "Micro-Job" Seed
*   **Goal:** Create the first real transaction flow.
*   **Action:**
    *   You (Maxi) act as the first "Client".
    *   Create 5 real micro-tasks on the platform (e.g., "Design a banner for Twitter", "Write a README", "Research competitor pricing").
    *   Post these "Bounties" in the Reddit/Discord channels. "First to claim and upload evidence gets paid instantly via MP."
    *   This forces users to actually *use* the Slice/Upload/Payout flow.

## 📊 3 Specific Next Steps (Quick Wins)

1.  **The "DevsArg" Post:** Write and post the "Anti-Upwork" manifesto on `r/devsarg`. Focus on local payment (Mercado Pago) and evidence-based reputation. Aim for 10 signups.
2.  **The "Bounty" List:** Create 3 real, low-cost tasks ($5-$10 USD equivalent in ARS) on the platform yourself. Use them as the "carrot" to get those 10 signups to actually log in and upload evidence.
3.  **The WhatsApp Infiltration:** Join 3 local trade/neighbor groups. Listen for 48h. Identify one "Key Opinion Leader" (someone who recommends others) and demo the tool to them via DM.
