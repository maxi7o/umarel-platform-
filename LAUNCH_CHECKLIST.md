## 🚧 Immediate Next Steps (The Final Polish)
 These items are recommended before "Public Launch" (removing the Beta label).

### A. Critical Quality Assurance (QA)
- [ ] **Mobile Safari Test:** Verify the "Role Selector" modal behaves correctly on iOS (z-index issues common).
- [ ] **Wizard Drop-off:** Check if users abandon the new 3-step wizard. (Add analytics events: `wizard_step_1`, `wizard_step_2`).
- [ ] **Seed Data Cleanup:** Ensure the seeded "fake" requests don't actually trigger emails to real users (if email service is live).

### B. Ops & Payments
- [ ] **Production Keys:** Switch Stripe/MercadoPago env vars from `TEST-...` to Live keys in Vercel Production.
- [ ] **Dispute Workflow:** Verify the "Admin Dashboard" actually allows resolving a disputed Escrow transaction.
- [ ] **Payout Schedule:** Confirm the Cronin "Daily Dividend" script runs successfully in production environment.

### C. Marketing Assets
- [ ] **Social Proof:** Replace the "A/B/C" placeholders in Testimonials with at least 3 real (or realistic) quotes.
- [ ] **SEO Meta:** Ensure `og:image` (OpenGraph) looks good when sharing links on WhatsApp (vital for Latam).

## 🔮 Post-Launch (Week 2-4)
- **Umarel Verification Exam:** A simple quiz for users to earn the "Umarel" badge automatically.
- **Provider Onboarding Drip:** Email sequence teaching providers how to "Slice" projects effectively.
